				<h5>Testimonial</h5>
				<p>“Over 15 years ago I learnt the basic Operational work 
from my father and in 2006 i started my own Twisting Machine Business to cater the Jerry need for the Saree Manufacturers. I generally take small amount of Loan from the Local Lenders for my regular Stock purchase and it is becoming difficult for me to pay actual and interest separately. But when Vistaar Executives explained about their unique Credit system of giving loans by analyzing respective Businesses. That actually made me to take a 
risk of Availing a Bigger amount of Loan for Constructing Manufacturing Facility. For my future Aspirations i've availed a Business Loan from Vistaar and utilized for Constructing Manufacturing Facility and regular Stock purchase. My Business is in doing great, i am one among the Valued Customers of Vistaar by paying the EMI on time with no Cheque bounces and I am also looking forward to take an another loan from Vistaar. Now I could able to pay Actual and Interest at one time in simple Emi's.”</p>
